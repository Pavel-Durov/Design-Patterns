In this assignment you will create a GameManger class which will have all the business logic of our game.
GameManger will be located in .dll (PCL) project and will be referenced from your UI project. 
* No need in fancy UI - Console Application is just fine..

GameManger - A singletone object that will be in charge of our game flow.



Game Entities:


Requirements:
There will be several Characters in our game: EnemyCharacter, PlayerCharacter etc... 

GameCharacter class declaration
abstract GameCharacter:
	properties: 
		StartPosition, X, Y, Step, Direction, Life, IsAlive, Damage etc...
	methods:
		MoveForward (advances the Character by step amount)
		TurnLeft	(rotates the cahrecter by 90 degrees to the left)
		TurnRight	(rotates the cahrecter by 90 degrees to the right)
		Hit			(accepts amount of damage and substructs it from Life property)
		etc...

CaveMonsterCharacter : GameCharacter
	....
GhostCharacter : GameCharacter
	....
PlayerCharacter : GameCharacter
	....

- You can find the code in HomeWork PCL project under HomeWork namespace

* All of the characters have to be created by a Factory (you can choose between Abstract and Method patterns)...
* Feel free to to add your logic.
* Feel free to craete your own characters, but make sure they all derives from GameCharacter object.
* You cannot remove methods/properties from GameCharacter class, but you can expand it.


Goodluck
