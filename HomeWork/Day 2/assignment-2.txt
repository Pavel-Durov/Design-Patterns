overed Design Patterns:
	BehavioralDesignPatterns: State / Observer / Strategy / Visitor / ChainOfResponsibility


In this assignment we will continue the previous projects - our "GameEngine".
TODO List:
	1. Implement State pattern inside of MovementHandler which will have those states:
		SlowMotion, Normal, HighSpeed which will advance the characters appropriately
	
	2. Implement Visitor pattern which will visit all our characters, with two visitors:
		EnhancePowerVisitr -> will add +2 for each enemy Damage
		SicknessVisitor -> will decreases -2 for each enemy Damage and decreases their health on each movement by 1
