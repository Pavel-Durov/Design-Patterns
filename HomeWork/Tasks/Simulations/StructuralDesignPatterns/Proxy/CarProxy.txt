	TODO: 
		1. Create a Car Proxy which will accept Driver in its constructor.
		2. Create an instance of a car object
		3. Implement DriveCarProxy function, which will check if the driver is drunk or underage and behave appropriately.
		
    interface ICar
    {
        void DriveCar();
    }

    public class Car : ICar
    {
        public void DriveCar()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Car has been driven!");
        }
    }

    public class Driver
    {
		public bool IsDrunk { get; set; }
        public int Age { get; set; }

        public Driver(int age)
        {
            this.Age = age;
        }
    }
