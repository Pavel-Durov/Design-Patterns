Facade Pattern:

	Remember our AtmMachine state pattern? We used it for describing Proxy pattern, this time you will be needed to create a Facade for it.
	

	Link to my Facade example on GitHub:
		https://github.com/Pavel-Durov/DesignPatterns-DN7/blob/master/BehavioralDesignPatterns/State/Model/AtmMachine.cs		
	
	TODO: 
		1. Create a Facade for our AtmMachine which will deal with all our bank authority logic.
		2. Each state will ask facade for the requested functionality, such as Withdraw, Pin code validation etc. Just look at our AtmMachine Example and act accordingly
