In this assignment, we are going to create a chain of responsibility of bureaucratic hierarchy.


TODO: 
	1. Create Purchase class, which will describe (surprisingly) "Purchase" object.
		Our Purchase object will have those properties:
			int Number, double Amount, string Purpose
	
	 
	2. Create abstract class called Approver:
		 abstract class Approver
		 {
		   protected Approver successor;
		
		   public void SetSuccessor(Approver successor)
		   {
		     this.successor = successor;
		   }
			
		   public abstract void ProcessRequest(Purchase purchase);
		 }
	
	3. Create another three objcets : VicePresident, President Director which will be a subclasses of our abstract Approver class.

	4. Create a chain of responsibility by those restrictions:

		1. Director can approve only Director Purchase which Amount is under 200
		2. VicePresident can approve only Director Purchase which Amount is under 1000
		3. President can approve only Director Purchase which Amount is under 100000

	5. What shall we do if no one can approve the Purchase?
