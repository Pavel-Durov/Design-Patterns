In this assignment we'll create a class called CompressionContext this class will be responsible for our file compression logic.

Compression Strategies:
    ZipCompressionStrategy, 
    RarCompressionStrategy, 
    7zipCompressionStrategy
	
CompressionContext functionality:
    CompressionContext(CompressStrategy strategy);
    public void Compress(List<FileInfo> files, string outputFilePath);
	
* There is no need to write the actual compression mechanism, just write some basic info to the Console.
