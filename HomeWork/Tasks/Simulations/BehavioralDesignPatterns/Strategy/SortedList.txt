	Create List class called SortedList, our list will have 3 sorting strategies:
		1. QuickSort
		2. MergeSort
		3. MergeSort

	TODO:
		1. Create a constructor in SortedList which will accept the Strategy (or will decide a default one). 
		2. Use the given strategy in SortedList as list values will be required by the user.
		3. Think about implementing some basic List functionality.
