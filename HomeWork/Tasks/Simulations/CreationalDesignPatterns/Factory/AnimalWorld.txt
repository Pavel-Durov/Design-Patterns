In this assignment, you will be asked to create an AnimalWorld object which uses Factories for its animal generation

Create two base kinds of entities:
	Carnivore (Meat Eater), Herbivore (Herb eater)
	1.	Carnivore will have one abstract method:
		Eat(Herbivore h);


	Examples:
		Lion  (Carnivore, Africa)
		Bison (Herbivore, America)
		Wolf  (Carnivore, Africa/America/Asia)
		Panda (Herbivore, Asia)
		Bunny (Herbivore, America/Asia)

	2. Create an abstract ContinentFactory
		With two abstract methods:
			CreateHerbivore, CreateCarnivore

	3. Create Concreate Factories:
		AfricaFactory : ContinentFactory
		AsiaFactory : ContinentFactory
		AmericaFactory : ContinentFactory

	4. Create another class called AnimalWorld.

		AnimalWorld will have a constructor with ContinentFactory as a parameter and will generate the Herbivore and Carnivore objects using delegation.

		AnimalWorld will have also, another method:
			RunFoodChain (which will call Eat method of our Carnivore object);

	5. Create AnimalWorld and Factories, and call RunFoodChain!
