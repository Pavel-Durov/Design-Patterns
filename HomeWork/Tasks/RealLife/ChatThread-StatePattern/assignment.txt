We are going to implement a chat thread, our chat can contain 3 types of messages: 
	1. Text Message
	2. Video Message
	

Text Message
	Display: Text

Video Message
	Display: Thumbnail/Video (Depends on state)

Vide Message can be in three states:
	Pause, Play, Stop

	Default State: Stop

	Stop State  -> Shows Thumbnail + shows Play Button.
	Pause State -> Shows current frame of the video + shows Play Button.
	Play State  -> Plays the video + shows the Pause button.

	States Flow:
		Stop -> Play -> Pause -> Play

	* Changing From Play state to Stop can be accomplish, only by playing the next message.
