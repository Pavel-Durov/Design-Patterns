In this assignment, we are going to implement ProcessExplorer class.

As you know, there is a lot of differences between 32 and 64 bit processes – that's why we need two different approaches for our Explorer.

You will be required to create a Process Explorer that will have 2 Strategies:
	Processx86Strategy, 	Processx64Strategy 

Classes - 

	Process:
		UInt AddressSize;
		UInt ThreadCount;
		UInt PID;
		String Description;
		String UserName;
		ImageType Type; //(32/64 bit type – need to be implemented as enum)

	Processx64: Process
		Override UInt AddressSize;
		Override ImageType Type;

	Processx86: Process
		Override UInt AddressSize;
		Override ImageType Type;


	ProcessExplorer:
		Public	ProcessExplorer(ProcessxStrategy strategy);
		public Explore(); //Your own implementation (print some process data to console)
