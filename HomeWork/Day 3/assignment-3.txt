In the last assignment we used Visitor and State patterns foir our GameEngine class behavioral enrichment.
This time, after we took a look at some Structural Design Patternswe can embed them as well in our logic:

TODO:
	Decorator Pattern :
		Will be used as Equipment of our PlayerCharacter - such as Shield, Halmet, Sword, etc...
		For instance, the PlayerCharacter will begin with no decorators at all, but as he advances through the game (by gaining Points or such) he will earn diffrent Decorators...
		
		
		1. Create a CharacterShieldItem which will give our PlayerCharacter an extra 50 Life.
		2. Create a CharacterSwordItem which will give our PlayerCharacter an extra 10 points to his Hit Damage.
		3. Use your imagination.. :)

	Facade Pattern:
		1. Create Facade for our game logic. Insted of calling function after function in our "Game Loop" the facade will be responsible fo the each game iteration.
