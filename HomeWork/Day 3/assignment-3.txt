In the last assignment we used Visitor and State patterns foir our GameEngine class behavioral enrichment.
This time, after we took a look at some Structural Design Patternswe can embed them as well in our logic:

TODO:
	Decorator Pattern :
		Will be used as Skins/Levels of our PlayerCharacter.
		For instance, the PlayerCharacter will begin with no decorator at all, but as he advances through the game (by gaining Points or such) he will earn diffrent Decorators...

		1. Create a PlayerCharacterSheildDecorator which will give our PlayerCharacter an extra 50 Life.
		2. Create a PlayerCharacterMadnessDecorator which will give our PlayerCharacter an extra 10 points to his Hit Damage.
		3. Use your imagination

	Flyweight Pattern :
		1. Create an GameWorldHandler object which will be responsible for our word creation (as we initialize the GameEngine).
		2. Bonus : Embed logic in GameWorldHandler for word change. For example: Night, Day etc...


	Facade:
		1. Create Facade for our game logic. Insted of calling function after function in our "Game Loop" the facade will be responsible fo the each game iteration.
